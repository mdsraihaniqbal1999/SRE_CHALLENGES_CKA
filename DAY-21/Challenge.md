# DevOps SRE Daily Challenge: Kubernetes Cluster Upgrades

## Hello Learners,

Welcome back to another thrilling episode of the **DevOps SRE Daily Challenge!** ðŸŽ‰

In the world of Kubernetes, keeping your clusters up-to-date isnâ€™t just a best practiceâ€”itâ€™s essential for ensuring security, stability, and access to the latest features. For DevOps engineers, SREs, and Kubernetes certification candidates, mastering cluster upgrades across diverse environments is a critical skill.

Whether youâ€™re managing clusters in local development environments, production-grade cloud infrastructures, or anything in between, understanding the nuances of different upgrade strategies will make you a Kubernetes pro!

## Why Cluster Upgrades Matter for Your Exam

### Real-World Relevance
Upgrading clusters is a routine task in production environments to patch vulnerabilities, improve performance, and enable new features. Understanding these processes prepares you for managing real-world Kubernetes workloads.

### Certification Preparation
Tasks related to version upgrades are commonly seen in certification exams like **CKA**. Being familiar with these workflows will save you valuable time during the test.

### Managed vs. Self-Hosted Clusters
Understanding the differences between upgrading **managed Kubernetes services like EKS** and **self-hosted clusters** is essential. Managed services often abstract some complexities but still require careful planning to ensure compatibility and performance. Self-hosted clusters offer more control but demand a deeper understanding of the upgrade process.

#### Best Practices:
- Always test upgrades in **staging** or **non-production environments** first.
- Backup your cluster and critical data before initiating any upgrade.
- Read the release notes carefully for deprecations and breaking changes.
- Automate where possible to ensure consistency and reduce human errors.

## Challenge Tasks

### **Theory Challenge: Understanding Cluster Upgrades**

#### Why Upgrade Clusters?
- Explain the importance of upgrading Kubernetes clusters in real-world scenarios.
- Discuss the risks of outdated cluster versions.

#### Upgrade Strategies:
- What are the typical upgrade approaches for Kubernetes clusters (e.g., **rolling upgrades, blue-green deployments**)?
- When should you choose one strategy over another?

#### Managed vs. Self-Hosted Clusters:
- Highlight the key differences in upgrade processes for **managed services like EKS** and **self-hosted clusters using tools like Kubeadm**.
- Discuss the unique challenges and best practices for each.

### **Practical Challenge: Upgrading Clusters in Different Environments**

#### **1. Minikube Cluster Upgrade**
- Upgrade your existing **Minikube** setup to the latest version.
- Verify that the Kubernetes version in the cluster matches the latest stable release.

#### **2. Kind Cluster Upgrade**
- Create a **Kind** cluster using an older Kubernetes version (e.g., `v1.30.8`).
- Upgrade the Kind cluster to the latest version.
- Confirm the version upgrade with `kubectl version`.

#### **3. Kubeadm Cluster Upgrade**
- Create a **multi-node Kubernetes cluster** using **Kubeadm**.
- Upgrade the **Control Plane** and **Nodes** to a newer Kubernetes version.
- Verify that all components (**kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, kube-scheduler, etc.**) are updated.

##### **Resources:**
- [Kubeadm Upgrade Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm-upgrade/)
- [Kubeadm Cluster Upgrade Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/kubeadm-upgrade/)
- [YouTube Video on Kubeadm Upgrades](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=kubeadm+upgrade)

#### **4. EKS Cluster Upgrade**
- Upgrade the **EKS Control Plane** to a newer version using **AWS CLI**.
- Update the **node groups** to match the Control Plane version.
- Confirm the upgrade with `kubectl version`.

**Note:** EKS also provides an **auto mode** for node groups, which simplifies the process of keeping your nodes up-to-date. While this reduces manual intervention, itâ€™s important to **monitor the process and validate workloads** after the upgrade to ensure seamless transitions.

##### **Best Practices:**
- Monitor your workloads during the upgrade to ensure there are no disruptions.
- Use a **phased approach** to minimize risks in production.
- Leverage **EKS version release notes** and upgrade tools to plan your upgrades effectively.
